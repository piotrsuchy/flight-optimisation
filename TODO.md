# TODO

- investigate why more flights are cancelled as the solutions are bigger
- check airport availability before flight start - and after duration on the destination airport
- add lanes to airport class - check availability of different starting lanes
- fix hardcodings - marked by TODOs in code
- allow overwork hours for pilot and crew but apply penalites maybe (?)

## Extra questions to think about

- what about a return flight after a period of time for passengers?
- what about planes being late, do I add that into the calculations?
- what about time zone considerations?
