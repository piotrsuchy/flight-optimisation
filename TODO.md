# TODO

## Both approaches

- penalty tracking - initial vs final to add to the fitness scores
- maybe add days off in the same way as training overlap (?)

## Unallowed approach

- add informed mutation
- create a way to create initial structures common

## Allowed approach

- getting the solutions form from the simulation
