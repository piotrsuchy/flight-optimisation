# TODO

## Both approaches

- use the same fitness function calculation for both approaches
- create a way to create initial structures common for both approaches - serializing objects into file
and reloading from file

## Unallowed approach

- add informed mutation
- add location fixing heuristic
- add time tracking, hours worked counting

## Allowed approach

- getting the solutions form from the simulation
