# TODO

- resimulation / restarting the simulation from a given point
- mutation - how to approach resimulation after each mutation
- crossover - how to make it so the crew / pilots assigned are not wrongly assigned

## DONE

- check airport availability before flight start - and after duration on the destination airport - **done**
- availability log + availability classes - track availability during simulation for each airport - **done**
- fix hardcodings - marked by TODOs in code - **done**

## Extra questions to think about

- what about a return flight after a period of time for passengers?
- what about planes being late, do I add that into the calculations?
- what about time zone considerations?
