# Flight Optimisation - Crew assignment optimization using approximate algorithms

This repository contains code for an engineering thesis which implements an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes crew assignment for an immutable flight schedule. The objective of this optimization is to minimize the operational costs and the penalties associated with wrong assignments, overtime work etc.
