# Flight Optimisation

## This repository will contain code for an engineering thesis about flight optimisation

With things like:

- pairing
- crew assignment
- schedule optimisation
etc. using an evolutionary algorithm.

## TODO steps

- find a dataset that will provide an overview of demand
- flight planning based on costs and profits
- download "DB1B Market (All Carriers)" database and use it for analysis of passangers

FLIGHT and PAS: These are likely to be units of measurement. "FLIGHT" could refer to the number of flights, while "PAS" likely refers to the number of passengers.

## DATABASE abbreviations

The "tra_meas" abbreviations are related to different measurements of passenger traffic:

CAF_PAS: This refers to the "Capacity" in terms of "Passengers". It might indicate the total number of seats available on all flights.

CAF_PAS_ARR: This refers to the "Capacity" in terms of "Passengers Arriving". It might indicate the total number of seats available on all arriving flights.

CAF_PAS_DEP: This refers to the "Capacity" in terms of "Passengers Departing". It might indicate the total number of seats available on all departing flights.

PAS_BRD: This refers to "Passengers Boarded". It might indicate the total number of passengers who boarded flights.

PAS_BRD_ARR: This refers to "Passengers Boarded Arriving". It might indicate the total number of passengers who boarded and arrived at the destination.

PAS_BRD_DEP: This refers to "Passengers Boarded Departing". It might indicate the total number of passengers who boarded and departed from the origin.

PAS_CRD: This refers to "Passengers Carried". It might indicate the total number of passengers carried on all flights.

PAS_CRD_ARR: This refers to "Passengers Carried Arriving". It might indicate the total number of passengers carried on all arriving flights.

PAS_CRD_DEP: This refers to "Passengers Carried Departing". It might indicate the total number of passengers carried on all departing flights.
