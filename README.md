# Flight Optimisation

## This repository will contain code for an engineering thesis about flight optimisation

With things like:

- pairing
- crew assignment
- schedule optimisation
etc. using an evolutionary algorithm.

## TODO steps

- find a dataset that will provide an overview of demand
- flight planning based on costs and profits
- download "DB1B Market (All Carriers)" database and use it for analysis of passangers
